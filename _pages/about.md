I'm a research scientist and engineer working with robots for grasping and navigation using deep learning. I develop robotic systems across several domains including assistive care, real-world, simulation, and video games. I work with several different robotic technologies including robots from [Fetch](https://fetchrobotics.com/), [Kinova](https://www.kinovarobotics.com/), [Staubli](https://www.staubli.com/en-us/robotics/), [Barrett](https://advanced.barrett.com/barretthand), [Seed](https://www.seedrobotics.com/), and [Intel Realsense](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html). I've worked on projects sponsored or afficilated with the [Army Research Lab](https://www.arl.army.mil/), [Google Robotics](https://research.google/teams/brain/robotics/), [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/), and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/). I've contributed to a number of open source frameworks, including [GraspIt!](https://graspit-simulator.github.io/).

I am a PhD from the [Columbia Robotics Lab](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/robotics/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), under supervision of [Prof. Peter Allen](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~allen/). My dissertation, Learning Mobile Manipulation, present a novel methodology for manipulating objects without the need for localization at runtime. 

While at the Columbia Robotics Lab and as an undergrad at Columbia University, I have either published or helped publish multiple research papers, assisted in teaching multiple courses, and participated in multiple entrepreneurship endeavours.
