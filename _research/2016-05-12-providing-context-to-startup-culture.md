Furthermore, this research also examined the impact of average sentiment surrounding the startup on the success of the startup. The research draws from in-person interviews, online articles written about these startups, and a sentiment analysis dataset of 26 startups in New York City. The report finds that the largest impact on the success of a startup is the consistency of a startup’s internal and external culture. PowerToFly had the lowest consistency score and the least funding, while Estimize and Betaworks both had higher consistency scores and more funding.
