I had the great fortune of giving a talk at **Brown University** about the exciting work we at **RAI Institute** are doing with **Foundation Models**.  
Thanks to George Konidaris and Stefanie Tellex for inviting me and organizing the event.  

I am excited to create state-of-the-art **robotics foundation models** to help the greater community!
