Hi Everyone,
As Peter mentioned in the last lab meeting, some high school students from Harlem Children's Zone STEM Exposure would be visiting the lab this week Thursday 11/21 (4:30-6:00p.m).

We will have multiple 10 mins presentations highlighting the different projects in our lab.
Talks will be at the CS Conference Room at 4:30pm:

    Ireti: BCI Shared Autonomy
    Bohan: Pixel attentive grasping, tactile refinement
    David: Multimodal Geometric Learning
    Jingxi:  Dynamic grasping
    Zizhao/Jack:  BCI control of robots
    Peter (deformable object grasping, medical robots).

Demos would follow in the Robotics Lab:

    Pixel-Attentive + Tactile
    Dynamic Grasping

Kindly let me know if you have any questions.
Many thanks,
