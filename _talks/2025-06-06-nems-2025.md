NEMS 2025 was an amazing event featuring the best and brightest minds of New England.  
We had over 140 attendees, with 18 different talks, two keynote speakers, and 44 posters.  
Thank you to my co-organizers Lael Odhner and Kait Becker.  

If you are interested in hosting NEMS in 2026, please reach out!  
It is a great opportunity to get connected with the robotics community.
