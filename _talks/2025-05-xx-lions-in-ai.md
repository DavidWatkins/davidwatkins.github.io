I had so much fun being on the **Lions in AI panel** last week!  
Barnet Sherman moderated a fantastic discussion with a series of expert panelists in AI and myself.  
We received thought-provoking questions about AI and society.  

It was wonderful to have Donna MacPhee, President of Columbia Alumni Association,  
kick us off and Karen J. Kalina, Co-President of CAAB, host us.  

Thank you again, CAAB!
