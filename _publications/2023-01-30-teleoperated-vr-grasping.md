# Abstract
Despite recent advancements in virtual reality technology, teleoperating a high degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot to complete dexterous tasks in cluttered scenes remains difficult. In this work, we propose a system that allows the user to teleoperate a Fetch robot to perform grasping in an easy and intuitive way by exploiting the rich environment information provided by the virtual reality space. Our system benefits from easy transferability to different robots and different tasks and can be used without any expert knowledge. We tested the system on a real Fetch robot, and a video demonstrating the effectiveness of our system can be seen at [this link](https://youtu.be/1-xW2Bx_Cms).
